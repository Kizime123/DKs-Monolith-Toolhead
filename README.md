# DKs-Monolith-Toolhead
Designed by https://github.com/abigexplosion

This Toolhead requires A LOT of post processing it's not for the faint of heart.

I intend to make some modified versions that have, improved CAD, a timeline (DK is a menance), Helicoil support, Regular BMG Support, PEEK tube lined filament path, 15/18mm CPAP tubing

I didn't make this CAD except the SLM Sherpa Micro idler and SLM 17-4PH Heatblock, The CAD is cursed as fuck and is not representitve of my work, I'll post my version seperately in the future.
