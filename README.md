# DKs-Monolith-Toolhead
Designed by https://github.com/abigexplosion

This Toolhead requires ALOT of post processing it's not for the faint of heart.

I intend to make some modified versions that have, improved CAD, a timeline (DK is a menance), Helicoil support, Regular BMG Support, PEEK tube lined filament path, 15/18mm CPAP tubing

This is all DK's CAD, except for the SLM Sherpa Micro idler and the SLM 17-4PH heatblock, which I made. There's also the belt clamp geometry designed by [CloakedWayne](https://github.com/CloakedWayne). The CAD is cursed as fuck and not representative of my work, I'll post my version separately in the future.
